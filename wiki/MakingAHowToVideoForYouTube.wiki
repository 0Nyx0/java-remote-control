#Making a HowTo video for YouTube using Java Screen Recorder.

= Introduction =

As part of the development of [www.rensmart.com|RenSMART.com] we wanted a number of videos showing how to use the web services. Using the Java screen recorder and the free Microsoft Movie Maker and RAD Video tools we created and edited a video of using the tools. Using the annotation option in YouTube we created a number of video how to guides.
